 * Type definitions for Cytoscape.js 2.4.2
 * Project: http://js.cytoscape.org/
 * Definitions by:  Fabian Schmidt
 *
 * Translation from Objects in help to Typescript interface.
 * cy   --> Cy.Instance
 * the core
 * ele  --> Cy.CollectionFirst
 * a collection of a single element (node or edge)
 * eles --> Cy.Collection
 * a collection of one or more elements (nodes and edges)
 * node --> Cy.CollectionFirstNode
 * a collection of a single node
 * nodes -> Cy.CollectionNodes
 * a collection of one or more nodes
 * edge --> Cy.CollectionFirstEdge
 * a collection of a single edge
 * edges -> Cy.CollectionEdges
 * a collection of one or more edges
 *
 * The library makes a diferrence between input and output parameter due to the dynamic behaviour of the Cytoscape library.
 * For a input parameter it will always expect:
 * - Cy.Collection
 *    The input can be any element (node and edge) collection.
 * - Cy.CollectionNodes
 *      The input must be a node collection.
 *  - Cy.CollectionEdges
 *     The input must be a edge collection.
 * - Cy.CollectionFirst
 *     The input must be a single element.
 *  - Cy.CollectionFirstNode
 *     The inut must be a single node.
 *  - Cy.CollectionFirstEdge
 *      The input must be a single edge.
 *
 * For a output of a function it will always give:
 *  - Cy.CollectionElements
 *      The output is a collection of node and edge elements OR single element.
 *  - Cy.CollectionEdges
 *      The output is a collection of edge elements OR single edge.
 *  - Cy.CollectionNodes
 *      The output is a collection of node elements OR single node.
